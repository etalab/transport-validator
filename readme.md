# Validate GTFS files

The General Transit Feed Specification ([GTFS](https://gtfs.org/)) defines a common format for public transportation schedules and associated geographic information.

This project is a validating tool for such files and can perform checks ranging from simple ones (the archive is not valid, a file is missing) to more complex ones (a vehicle is moving too fast).

## Online tool
transport-validator is the tool used by the [French National Access Point](https://transport.data.gouv.fr/) to validate GTFS files. If you want to use it online, you can validate your own files at [this address](https://transport.data.gouv.fr/validation?locale=en).


## Validation output
Validation output is twofold:
* it gives useful information about the validated file, under the `metadata` entry
* it lists a serie of validation items, with a corresponding severity, under the `validations` entry. When relevant, geographical data ([GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/)) related to the issue is given to ease file debugging.

The output is by default formatted in `json`, but `yaml` is also available. See [Options](https://github.com/etalab/transport-validator#options) for more information.

```json
{
    "metadata": {
        ...
    },
    "validations": {
       ...
    }
}
```

### Metadata

| networks | list of strings | A list of unique agencies names, found in `agency.txt` | 
| networks_start_end_dates | map | Gives the starting and ending dates of the calendar information for each network. For example: `{"agency name 1":{"start_date":"2022-08-18","end_date":"2022-10-23"}, "agency name 2":{"start_date":"2020-08-18","end_date":"2023-10-23"}}` | 
| modes | list of strings | A list of the `route_types` found in `routes.txt` | 
| issues_count| Object | A summary of the validation issues found in the `validations` section. Keys of the object are the issue name, values are the number of corresponding issues found. |
| has_fares | boolean | True if a `fare_attributes.txt` file exists and contains information |
| has_shapes | boolean | True if a `shapes.txt` file exists and contains information |
| has_pathways | boolean | True if a `pathways.txt` file exists and contains information |
| lines_with_custom_color_count | integer | Number of routes found in `routes.txt` with a custom `route_color` or a custom `route_text_color`. Custom means different from the default values. |
| some_stops_need_phone_agency | boolean | Some stops have a `continuous_pickup` or a `continuous_drop_off` field equal to `2`. |
| some_stops_need_phone_driver | boolean | Some stops have a `continuous_pickup` or a `continuous_drop_off` field equal to `3`. |

## Validations
The `"validations"` key contains the actual validation results.
### Severity

Each check is associated with a severity level.

| Severity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Fatal | Critical error, the GTFS archive couldn't be opened |
| Error | The file does not respect the GTFS specification |
| Warning | Not a specification error, but something is most likely wrong in the data |
| Information | Simple information |

### List of checks
The validator performs a number of checks. The list of checks can be seen in the file [issues.rs](https://github.com/etalab/transport-validator/blob/master/src/issues.rs#L21-L83).

Here is a human friendly list of them :

| check name                      | Severity | Description                                                                                     |

### Geojson information
When relevant for the check, geojson information is added for each check output, making the GTFS debug process easier.

### Example

Here is a validation output containing one warning, triggered by a non Ascii Stop id:

```json
"validations": {
    "IdNotAscii" : [
        {
            "severity": "Warning",
            "issue_type": "IdNotAscii",
            "object_id": "AllBél",
            "object_type": "Stop",
            "object_name": "",
            "related_objects": [],
            "geojson": {
                "features": [
                    {
                        "geometry": null,
                        "properties": {
                            "id": "AllBél",
                            "name": ""
                        },
                        "type": "Feature"
                    }
                ],
                "type": "FeatureCollection"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Another example showing the GeoJSON information for an information about two stops too close:

```json
    "validations": {
        "CloseStops": [
            {
                "severity": "Information",

## Installation

1. This project is written in Rust. You need to first [install Rust](https://rustup.rs/) on your machine.

2. Clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/etalab/transport-validator/
cd transport-validator
```
## Run the validator

### Run from a local directory
The release version can be run as:

`cargo run --release -- --input test_data/unused_stop`

It is the fastest and recommanded version to use when validating files.

If you are developping on the validator, you can also run a debug build:

`cargo run -- --input test_data/unused_stop`

The validator can read a zip file, or an url:

```
cargo run --release -- -i some_gtfs.zip
cargo run --release -- -i https://example.com/network.gfts
```

### Run as a dæmon

The validator can run as a HTTP dæmon to validate any file from a url.

For now the call is synchronous. Be aware that if the file is large, the time required to download the GTFS zip, the request might time out.

The command to launch the dæmon is:

`cargo run --release`

You can then ask for a validation:

`curl http://localhost:7878/validate?url=https://example.com/gtfs.zip`

## Options

* `--input` or `-i`: Path (can be a directory or a zip file) or HTTP URL (file will be downloaded) of the GTFS file.
* `--max-issues` or `-m`: The maxium number of issues per type. Defaults to 1000.
* `--output-format` or `-f`: Output format (when using the validator in command line). Value by default is `json`, but `yaml` is also available.
* `--custom-rules` or `-c`: Path to a YAML file containing custom values to use during the validation.

## Custom rules
Some values used during the validations can be customized by using the `--custom-rules` option and providing a path to a YAML file.

Available customizations are:

|Field|Description|
|--|--|
| max_tramway_speed | Maximum speed in km/h on a route_type `tramway` before triggering an `ExcessiveSpeed` warning |
| max_subway_speed | Maximum speed in km/h on a route_type `subway` before triggering an `ExcessiveSpeed` warning |
| max_rail_speed | Maximum speed in km/h on a route_type `rail` before triggering an `ExcessiveSpeed` warning |
| max_bus_speed | Maximum speed in km/h on a route_type `bus` before triggering an `ExcessiveSpeed` warning |
| max_ferry_speed | Maximum speed in km/h on a route_type `ferry` before triggering an `ExcessiveSpeed` warning |
| max_cable_car_speed | Maximum speed in km/h on a route_type `cable car` before triggering an `ExcessiveSpeed` warning |
| max_gondola_speed | Maximum speed in km/h on a route_type `gondola` before triggering an `ExcessiveSpeed` warning |
| max_funicular_speed | Maximum speed in km/h on a route_type `funicular` before triggering an `ExcessiveSpeed` warning |
| max_coach_speed | Maximum speed in km/h on a route_type `coach` before triggering an `ExcessiveSpeed` warning |
| max_air_speed | Maximum speed in km/h on a route_type `air` before triggering an `ExcessiveSpeed` warning |
| max_taxi_speed | Maximum speed in km/h on a route_type `taxi` before triggering an `ExcessiveSpeed` warning |
| max_other_speed | Maximum speed in km/h on a route_type `other` before triggering an `ExcessiveSpeed` warning |

### Example

```yaml
max_bus_speed: 120
max_gondola_speed: 50
```
If you need to customize other values, please [let us know](https://github.com/etalab/transport-validator/issues/new).
